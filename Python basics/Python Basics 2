//  (is VS == operator) Exercise

The 'is' keyword is used to test if two variables refer to the same object.
The test returns True if the two objects are the same object.
The test returns False if they are not the same object, even if the two objects are 100% equal.

Use the == operator to test if two variables are equal.

print ( True == 1 )
print ( [] == 1 )
print ( '' == 1 )
print ( 10 == 10.0 )
print ( [] == [] )
print ( [1,2,3] is [1,2,3] )

OUT: True
OUT: False
OUT: False
OUT: True
OUT: True
OUT: True

print ( True is 1 )
print ( [] is 1 )
print ( '' is 1 )
print ( 10 is 10.0 )
print ( [] is [] )
print ( True is True )
print ( 1 is 1 )
print ( '1' is '1' )
print ( [1,2,3] is [1,2,3] )


x = [1,2,3]
y = [1,2,3]
print(x is y)                OUT: False

x = [1,2,3]
y = x
print(x is y)                OUT: True

//# Printing total sum of the list
